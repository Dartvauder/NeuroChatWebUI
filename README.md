## Description:

Simple and easy interface for use of different neural network models. You can chat with LLM using text or voice input, StableDiffusion for generating images and AudioCraft for generating audio

The goal of the project - to create the easiest possible application to use neural network models

## How to use:

#### Interface has four tabs: LLM, Stable Diffusion, AudioCraft and Settings. Select the one you need and follow the instructions below 

### LLM:

1) First upload your models to the folder: *inputs/text/llm_models*
2) Select your model from the drop-down list
3) Select model type (`transformers` or `llama`)
4) Set up the model according to the parameters you need
5) Type (or speak) your request
6) Click the `Submit` button to receive the generated text and audio response
#### Optional: you can enable `TTS` mode, select the `voice` and `language` needed to receive an audio response. You can also select `avatar`
#### Avatars = *inputs/image/avatars*
#### Voice samples = *inputs/audio/voices*
#### The voice must be pre-processed (22050 kHz, mono, WAV), the avatar should preferably be `PNG` or `JPG`

### StableDiffusion - has four sub-tabs:

#### txt2img:

1) First upload your models to the folder: *inputs/image/sd_models*
2) Select your model from the drop-down list
3) Select model type (`SD`, `SD2` or `SDXL`)
4) Set up the model according to the parameters you need
5) Enter your request
6) Click the `Submit` button to get the generated image
#### Optional: You can select your `vae` and `lora` models to improve the generation method, also you can enable `upscale` to increase the size of the generated image 
#### vae = *inputs/image/sd_models/vae*
#### lora = *inputs/image/sd_models/lora*

#### img2img:

1) First upload your models to the folder: *inputs/image/sd_models*
2) Select your model from the drop-down list
3) Select model type (`SD`, `SD2` or `SDXL`)
4) Set up the model according to the parameters you need
5) Upload the initial image with which the generation will take place
6) Enter your request
7) Click the `Submit` button to get the generated image
#### Optional: You can select your `vae` model
#### vae = *inputs/image/sd_models/vae*

#### inpaint:

1) First upload your models to the folder: *inputs/image/sd_models/inpaint*
2) Select your model from the drop-down list
3) Select model type (`SD`, `SD2` or `SDXL`)
4) Set up the model according to the parameters you need
5) Upload the image with which the generation will take place to `initial image` and `mask image`
6) In `mask image`, select the brush, then the palette and change the color to `#FFFFFF`
7) Draw a place for generation and enter your request
8) Click the `Submit` button to get the inpainted image
#### Optional: You can select your `vae` model
#### vae = *inputs/image/sd_models/vae*

#### extras:

1) Select the options you need
2) Upload the initial image
3) Click the `Submit` button to get the modified image

### AudioCraft:

1) Select a model from the drop-down list
2) Select model type (`musicgen` or `audiogen`)
3) Set up the model according to the parameters you need
4) Enter your request
5) (Optional) upload the initial audio if you are using `melody` model 
6) Click the `Submit` button to get the generated audio
#### Optional: You can enable `multiband diffusion` to improve the generated audio

### Settings: 

* Here you can change the application settings. For now you can only change `Share` mode to `True` or `False`

### Additional Information:

1) Chat history, generated images and generated audio, are saved in the *outputs* folder
2) You can press the `Clear` button to reset your selection
3) To stop the generation process, click the `Stop generation` button
4) You can turn off the application using the `Close terminal` button
5) You can open the *outputs* folder by clicking on the `Folder` button


## Where can I get models, voices and avatars?

* LLM models can be taken from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models)
* StableDiffusion, vae, inpaint and lora models can be taken from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models)
* AudioCraft models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder, when you select a model and press the submit button
* TTS, Whisper, Upscale and Multiband diffusion models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder when are they used 
* You can take voices anywhere. Record yours or take a recording from the Internet. The main thing is that it is pre-processed!
* It’s the same with avatars as with voices. You can download them on the Internet, generate them using neural networks, or take a photo of yourself. The main thing is to comply with the required file format

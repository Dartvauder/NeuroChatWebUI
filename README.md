## Description:

Simple and easy interface for use of different neural network models. You can chat with LLM using text or voice input, use StableDiffusion for generating images and videos, AudioCraft for generating audio, CoquiTTS for text to speech and OpenAI-Whisper for speech to text. Also you can download LLM and StableDiffusion models, and change application settings inside interface

The goal of the project - to create the easiest possible application to use neural network models

### ModelDownloader:

* Here you can download `LLM` and `StableDiffusion` models. Just choose the model from the drop-down list and click the `Submit` button
#### `LLM` models are downloaded here: *inputs/text/llm_models*
#### `StableDiffusion` models are downloaded here: *inputs/image/sd_models*

### Settings:

### Additional Information:

1) Chat history, generated images and generated audio, are saved in the *outputs* folder
2) You can press the `Clear` button to reset your selection
3) To stop the generation process, click the `Stop generation` button
4) You can turn off the application using the `Close terminal` button
5) You can open the *outputs* folder by clicking on the `Folder` button

## Where can I get models, voices and avatars?

* LLM models can be taken from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) or from ModelDownloader inside interface
* StableDiffusion, vae, inpaint, embedding and lora models can be taken from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models) or from ModelDownloader inside interface
* AudioCraft models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder, when you select a model and press the submit button
* TTS, Whisper, Upscale and Multiband diffusion models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder when are they used 
* You can take voices anywhere. Record yours or take a recording from the Internet. Or just use those that are already in the project. The main thing is that it is pre-processed!
* It’s the same with avatars as with voices. You can download them on the Internet, generate them using neural networks, or take a photo of yourself. The main thing is to comply with the required file format

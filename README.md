## Description:

A simple and convenient interface for using various neural network models. You can communicate with LLM and BLIP-2 using text, voice and image input, use StableDiffusion to generate images and videos, Shap-E to generate 3D objects, AudioCraft and AudioLDM 2 to generate music and audio, CoquiTTS and SunoBark for text-to-speech, OpenAI-Whisper for speech-to-text, LibreTranslate for text translation and Demucs for audio file separation. You can also download the LLM and StableDiffusion models, change the application settings inside the interface and check system sensors

The goal of the project - to create the easiest possible application to use neural network models

## Where can i get models and voices?

* LLM models can be taken from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models) or from ModelDownloader inside interface 
* StableDiffusion, vae, inpaint, embedding and lora models can be taken from [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/models) or from ModelDownloader inside interface
* AudioCraft and AudioLDM 2 models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder, when you select a model and press the submit button
* TTS, Whisper, SunoBark, BLIP-2, Upscale, Depth, Videos, Cascade, Rembg, Shap-E, Demucs and Multiband diffusion models are downloads automatically in *inputs* folder when are they used 
* You can take voices anywhere. Record yours or take a recording from the Internet. Or just use those that are already in the project. The main thing is that it is pre-processed!
